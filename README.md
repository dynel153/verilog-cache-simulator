# verilog-cache-simulator
Log Entry 1: GitHub Repository Setup
Initialized a GitHub repository and established a clear directory structure:

direct_mapped/

set_associative_2way/

set_associative_4way/

unified_testbench/ (for validation and top-level testbench)

Verified Git installation, linked the local repository with GitHub, and confirmed successful commits and pushes.

Log Entry 2: Direct-Mapped Cache Modules
Created cache_direct.v and cache_directl2.v to model L1 and L2 direct-mapped caches. Implemented tag matching, block replacement, and validity checks.

Faced SystemVerilog syntax issues when declaring loop variables inside procedural blocks. Resolved this by moving declarations outside. Verified correct behavior on cache hits and implemented block replacement on misses.

Log Entry 3: Direct-Mapped Cache System Integration
Developed cache_system_direct.v, integrating both cache_direct (L1) and cache_directl2 (L2). The system checks L1 first, then L2 on a miss. If L2 hits, the block is promoted to L1.

Encountered warnings due to mismatched read_data widths (initially 11-bit). Standardized all data paths to 32-bit to eliminate binding issues and padding inconsistencies.

Log Entry 4: 2-Way Set-Associative Cache System
Implemented cache_system_2way.v with L1 and L2 2-way set-associative caches. Each used tag arrays, valid bits, and 2D data arrays. Added an LRU replacement strategy using a single-bit per set.

Address decomposition (tag/index/offset) was calculated dynamically using clog2. Debugged tag mismatch and LRU update errors due to incorrect indexing logic. Once corrected, L2-to-L1 promotions worked as expected.

Log Entry 5: 4-Way Set-Associative Modules & Hierarchy
Built a modular 4-way set-associative system using:

cache_4way.v (L1)

cache_4wayl2.v (L2)

cache_system_4way.v (integration)

Implemented pseudo-LRU replacement and verified block lookup, tag matching, and promotions. Challenges included:

Tag width misalignment causing false positives

Block index errors resulting in incorrect eviction

Resolved by carefully recalculating address slicing and refining control logic. Validated correct functionality using targeted address patterns. Reused these modules in the final unified testbench.

Log Entry 6: Unified Testbench Development
Created test_cache_all.v to simulate all three systems (Direct, 2-Way, 4-Way). Early versions tested static addresses and printed hit/miss indicators.

Reorganized wires and resolved output port conflicts to allow independent cache evaluation. Verified that results were stable and accurate.

Log Entry 7: Randomized Access Testing
Enhanced the testbench to simulate 10,000 random memory accesses ($random % 2048). Added counters for hit/miss tracking and printed results per iteration.

Validated expected cold-start behavior and tracked consistent hit rates. Ensured random access did not destabilize results across cache types.

Log Entry 8: AMAT Calculation and Final Validation
Implemented AMAT (Average Memory Access Time) calculation using:

ini
Copy
Edit
AMAT = L1_time + (miss_rate × (L2_time + (1 - L2_hit_rate) × main_memory_time))
Assumed:

L1: 1 cycle

L2: 5 cycles

Main memory: 100 cycles

L2 hit probability: calculated per system

Final output (10,000 addresses):

Direct-Mapped: 1227 hits, 8773 misses → AMAT = 49.25 cycles

2-Way: 595 hits, 9405 misses → AMAT = 52.73 cycles

4-Way: 311 hits, 9689 misses → AMAT = 54.29 cycles

Verified correctness with simulation output. Project completed and final push made to GitHub.

verilog-cache-simulator
Log Entry 1: GitHub Repository Setup
Initialized a new GitHub repository for the project. Created the standard directory layout with subfolders for each cache configuration: direct_mapped, set_associative_2way, set_associative_4way, and a shared unified_testbench folder for top-level validation. Confirmed Git installation and linked the local repository with GitHub. Verified that commits and pushes worked properly.

Log Entry 2: Direct-Mapped Cache Modules
Wrote cache_direct.v and cache_directl2.v to implement simple direct-mapped L1 and L2 cache modules. Simulated each with a fixed number of blocks and implemented basic tag checking and valid-bit logic. Encountered SystemVerilog syntax errors when declaring variables (e.g., loop index i) inside procedural blocks. Moved all such declarations outside the blocks to resolve the issue. Ensured each cache could respond with simulated data on a hit and initiate tag replacement on a miss.

Log Entry 3: Direct Cache System Integration
Developed cache_system_direct.v, integrating both cache_direct and cache_directl2. Managed L1 and L2 behavior in sequence: if L1 missed but L2 hit, the block would be promoted to L1. Initially used mismatched data widths (11-bit read_data), which caused port binding warnings. Corrected all modules to use 32-bit-wide read_data to maintain consistency and avoid padding-related issues.

Log Entry 4: 2-Way Set-Associative Cache System
Implemented cache_system_2way.v to simulate 2-way set-associative caches with internal data and tag arrays. Designed LRU-based replacement for both L1 and L2 using a single-bit policy. Calculated tag, index, and offset widths programmatically using a clog2 function. Encountered indexing issues in tag extraction and LRU assignment, which were fixed after correcting the address slicing logic. Confirmed that promotion from L2 to L1 occurred properly.

Log Entry 5: 4-Way Set-Associative Cache Modules and Hierarchical Staging
Constructed a complete 4-way set-associative hierarchy consisting of cache_4way.v, cache_4wayl2.v, and cache_system_4way.v. Each cache used 4 sets and supported pseudo-LRU (Least Recently Used) logic for replacement. Implemented the L1–L2 hierarchy by first checking L1 for a hit. If missed, L2 was queried and, upon a hit, data was promoted from L2 to L1.

Faced a number of challenges:

Incorrect tag width slicing caused false hits and alignment errors.

Block indexing misaligned with associativity led to overwrite bugs.

Fixed these issues by carefully verifying address decomposition (tag/index/offset) and restructuring control logic for multi-way replacement. Validated cache behavior using controlled address patterns. L1 and L2 caches correctly handled miss promotion and LRU updates. Confirmed that the modular design allowed cache_4way.v and cache_4wayl2.v to be reused independently in different systems. Later used this system in the unified testbench.

Log Entry 6: Unified Testbench Development
Developed test_cache_all.v to run a single simulation comparing all three cache systems side-by-side. Initially tested using fixed addresses (e.g., 0x020, 0x040) and printed hit/miss counts for each access. Detected and resolved errors with output ports and signal naming. Reorganized wiring to prevent conflict across instances and ensure all caches could respond independently. Verified output consistency.

Log Entry 7: Randomized Access Testing Implementation
Extended test_cache_all.v to generate 10,000 random memory accesses using $random % 2048. Replaced static tests with a loop-based simulation. Tracked per-cache hit/miss rates with dedicated counters. Printed access summary for each iteration, showing address and per-cache result (HIT or MISS). Verified that cache logic scaled across random input and output remained stable. Observed expected miss rates for cold-start behavior.

Log Entry 8: AMAT Calculation Integration and Final Validation
Integrated Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) calculation at the end of test_cache_all.v. Defined real variables outside of the initial block to avoid syntax errors. Used the formula:

AMAT = L1_time + (miss_rate * (L2_time + (1 - L2_hit_prob) * mem_time))

Assumed constants: L1 = 1 cycle, L2 = 5 cycles, main memory = 100 cycles, L2 hit probability = 0.5. Calculated miss rates from counter values. Verified correct output:

Direct-Mapped: Hits = 1227, Misses = 8773 → AMAT = 49.25 cycles

2-Way Set: Hits = 595, Misses = 9405 → AMAT = 52.73 cycles

4-Way Set: Hits = 311, Misses = 9689 → AMAT = 54.29 cycles

Ran simulation using iverilog and vvp. Output matched expectations. Committed and pushed final codebase to GitHub. Cache simulation project completed successfully.
